# 🦎
Helpful zig abstractions.


# 🏗️
Test by running `zig build test` from the root. 

# 📇
Uses zig version `0.15.1`.

# 📋 To-Do
- [ ] 📜 CLI for `spot_check` and `clear_at_end` in `src/all-tests.zig`
- [ ] 🗃️ `gitignore` for test files and folders
	- Probably can be read from some shared config file
- [ ] 🧟 Fixed cursed save-as logic and naming conventions in `save.zig` and `path.zig`
    - [ ] 🧪 Add tests for these as well
- [ ] 📇 Establish naming and arg-order conventions (especially for allocators)
